Similarities:
Both commands are used to integrate changes from one branch into another.

Differences:

merge creates a new merge commit, preserving the history of branches. This maintains the context of the branching process.
rebase rewrites history by relocating commits to the end of the base branch, which results in a linear history.
Pros and Cons:

merge:
Pros: Keeps an exact history of changes and branch interactions.
Cons: Can lead to a complex and tangled repository history.
rebase:
Pros: Creates a clean, linear history, simplifying the understanding of changes.
Cons: Can be risky for shared branches as it alters the commit history.
Usage Recommendations:

Use merge for combining major development branches where it is important to preserve the history of interactions.
Prefer rebase for cleaning up history before integrating changes into the main branch, especially when working on local changes.
